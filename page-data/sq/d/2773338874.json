I've always loved to program, and have had many times when I thought I would make the shift, but I always got cold feet or thought 'It's not for me'.

They've also shown me how far I still need to go. It's a great feeling to take a problem from the \"Cracking the Coding Interview or coding websites and figure out a solution that works and is not the brute force method (although sometimes just knowing I can figure out the brute force can feel like a success story). The 'issues' come when trying to find the most optimal solutions. You see that some of your test cases have timed out or you look at other's solutions and see how much better/faster they are than yours. It's not the best of feelings, but seeing these other solutions is also something I can aspire to with practice and dedication.","marks":[]}]},{"children":[{"text":"Take for instance the sudoku project I've been working on (see my last post).

If we want to bring more people into the field of computer science we should make sure we use variable names and comments that you doesn't need an expert to understand what is going on.

It was in a newspaper I was looking at while I was at the table with my parents and the 'not-quite-math, but math' aspect of it just clicked with me. Having to logically determine which number goes where based solely on known information and following a set of rules resonated with my interest in programming, logic, mathematics, and, to an extent, gaming. It was a more refined Minesweeper that didn't feel unfair or require any guessing. It was also cool to see multiple kinds of sudokus, from the vanilla 9x9 with 3x3 regions, to those with not jigsaw shaped regions, some with diagonals and some with additional 3x3 regions (hyper-sudoku). There were even some that had variations on size or some where it was two or more connected puzzles.","marks":[]}]},{"children":[{"text":"Doing all these sudoku puzzles also opened up my puzzle worldview.

In 2016 when I was looking for a project to use to teach myself Python I figured why not try to create a program that solved sudoku puzzles.

Boy was I ","marks":[]},{"text":"almost","marks":["em"]},{"text":" wrong. There are a lot of way where we take for granted the way our brains work, and translating that into an algorithm is not always light work. But at the end of the day, I was able to put together a somewhat crude solution that represented a sudoku puzzle as a grid and did a whole bunch of work to solve them using lots of arrays and loops.","marks":[]}]},{"children":[{"text":"Fast forward to 2021 and I thought it was about time for me to update my old program. I knew I could do better both in terms of the structure and the logic. I first took to abstracting the problem. In my original iteration the program was technically one file with a class, but in my new version I decided to actually separate the files and create more classes. I went from just having a class that represents a sudoku cell, to also having a class for a sudoku region (a collection of cells) and a sudoku puzzle (a collection of regions) with each class having functions that do the appropriate work. I had a big \"A ha!\" moment when I was on a walk with my wife, son, and dog (one of many of these moments during walks) where I realized that sudoku columns and rows are just regions with specific meaning and they function just as the 3x3 grids, jigsaw shapes, or diagonals do. This also made me realize that generally most sudoku solving techniques are relegated to one region and and looking at the potential options for each cell.","marks":[]}]},{"children":[{"text":"There are many other things I can talk about, such as brainstorming ways to make the program require less computing time and space (thinking of you, Big-O) or adding additional solving techniques (currently it only does hidden singles and naked singles and pairs), but those stories might come at another time, as this post is getting long enough. For now, I'll keep hacking away at this 'problem' and doing more puzzles.","marks":[]}]},{"children":[{"text":"(Image Note: Bridging the gap between physical and digital sudoku)","marks":[]}]},{"children":[{"text":"Image credit:","marks":[]}]},{"children":[{"text":"\"Nixie sudoku\"","marks":["fcef5bb5270d"]},{"text":" by ","marks":[]},{"text":"TeaWithBuzz","marks":["0e6184fc75eb"]},{"text":" is licensed under ","marks":[]},{"text":"CC BY-NC-SA 2.0","marks":["fde754671c1a"]}]}],"author":{"name":"Dan Gaylord"},"mainImage":{"asset":{"gatsbyImageData":{"images":{"sources":[],"fallback":{"src":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/aaw5oc1t/production/fe7108e6a26fb8d4ff50fae626df15c796b5e21b-1024x768.jpg?w=1024&h=768&auto=format","srcSet":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/aaw5oc1t/production/fe7108e6a26fb8d4ff50fae626df15c796b5e21b-1024x768.jpg?w=320&h=240&auto=format 320w,\nhttps://cdn.sanity.io/images/aaw5oc1t/production/fe7108e6a26fb8d4ff50fae626df15c796b5e21b-1024x768.jpg?rect=1,0,1023,768&w=654&h=491&auto=format 654w,\nhttps://cdn.sanity.io/images/aaw5oc1t/production/fe7108e6a26fb8d4ff50fae626df15c796b5e21b-1024x768.jpg?w=768&h=576&auto=format 768w,\nhttps://cdn.sanity.io/images/aaw5oc1t/production/fe7108e6a26fb8d4ff50fae626df15c796b5e21b-1024x768.jpg?w=1024&h=768&auto=format 1024w","sizes":"(min-width: 1024px) 1024px, 100vw"}},"layout":"constrained","width":1024,"height":768,"placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"}}}}}},{"node":{"id":"-6b17ccf2-eb42-5cf1-9a0a-62873ec7db2f","slug":{"current":"this-is-not-a-test"},"title":"This is (not) a Test","body":[{"children":[{"text":"Everything has a beginning, middle, and an end...hopefully this is just the beginning!","marks":[]}]},{"children":[{"text":"This site is a long time coming, and frankly should have been created ","marks":[]},{"text":"years","marks":["em"]},{"text":" ago when I first got into coding for fun.
